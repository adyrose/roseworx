A Core js file is an **enhancement** on something which works as standard with css only.

A Component js file needs an element in a certain structure physically in the dom which **requires** javascript in order to function.

A Module js file is Javascript which does something "in the background" and doesnt specifically require a physical element in the dom.

Core js is automatically included and ran on the initial import of roseworx, Components and Modules need importing specifically.
